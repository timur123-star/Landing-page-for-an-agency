## About this project

NOVA Agency is a portfolio piece — a single-page studio website with case studies, a
journal, a contact form, and the kind of polish you would expect from a real product
agency: smooth scroll, animated hero, scroll-spy navigation, command palette, dynamic OG
images, four locales, dark and light themes, and end-to-end accessibility.

The whole site is hand-crafted: no CMS, no boilerplate template, no design system bought off
the shelf. Every section, animation, illustration, and translation lives in this repo.

> **Disclaimer.** NOVA Agency is not a real company — the brand, copy, case studies, and
> testimonials are fictional, written for portfolio purposes only.
> Designed and built by **Тимур Валерьевич**.

> **Companion product — Lumen Analytics.** This landing page is the first half of a
> two-part portfolio piece. The fictional studio NOVA Agency "built" **Lumen Analytics** —
> a login-gated, multilingual SaaS analytics dashboard with a streaming Groq AI assistant,
> ⌘K palette, view-transition theme switch and seeded PRNG demo data — explore it live at
> [lumen-analytics-new.up.railway.app](https://lumen-analytics-new.up.railway.app/)
> ([source](https://github.com/timur123-star/Lumen-Analytics)). Together they tell a single
> product story: agency landing → product dashboard.

## What is inside

### Pages

- **`/`** — landing page with 11 sections (hero → logos → problem/solution → services →
  process → cases → stats → testimonials → pricing → FAQ → contact).
- **`/work`** — index of case studies with filterable categories.
- **`/work/[slug]`** — individual case study with context, approach, results, gallery, and
  reading-progress bar.
- **`/journal`** — articles from the studio.
- **`/journal/[slug]`** — long-form post with sticky table of contents, transliterated
  anchor IDs, and a reading-progress bar.
- **`/404`** — branded not-found with glitch animation.

### Localisation

Four locales served from one codebase via `next-intl`:

| Code | Language | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ru` | Русский | `/` *(default, no prefix)* |
| `en` | English | `/en` |
| `uk` | Українська | `/uk` |
| `es` | Español | `/es` |

Each locale has its own `<html lang>`, metadata, OG image, sitemap entries, and
translated copy across every section, page, case study, and journal post.

### Animations & micro-interactions

Every animation honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- Lenis smooth scroll with custom easing.
- Word-by-word stagger reveal on every heading (`AnimatedText`).
- Scroll-spy in the header — animated pill highlights the active section.
- Magnetic CTAs with spring physics.
- Custom blend-mode cursor that grows on interactive elements.
- Intro splash on first visit (gated by `sessionStorage`).
- Theme switch with View Transitions API and radial clip-path reveal.
- 3D parallax tilt on the hero product mockup.
- Card-spotlight effect (radial gradient that follows the cursor).
- Marquee carousels for logos and testimonials with pause-on-hover.
- Animated counters and progress bars triggered on scroll.
- Hover shine sweep on every primary button.
- Animated SVG connector linking the four steps in the process section.

### UX details

- `⌘ K` / `Ctrl+K` command palette (layout-independent — works with Russian keyboards too).
- Section indicator on the right edge of the viewport (lg+).
- Reading-progress bar on long pages.
- Sticky table of contents in the journal with auto-generated anchors.
- Skip-to-content link, global focus-visible rings, ARIA-correct disclosure widgets.
- Back-to-top button after 600px of scroll.
- Click-to-copy email with toast confirmation.

### SEO & analytics

- Locale-aware `metadata`, OpenGraph, Twitter cards.
- JSON-LD: `Organization`, `WebSite`, `FAQPage`, `CollectionPage`, `Blog`, `BlogPosting`.
- Per-page dynamic OG images (1200×630) generated at the edge via `next/og`.
- Sitemap with locale alternates, `robots.txt`, web manifest, full icon set.
- Live Lighthouse badge in the footer powered by the PageSpeed Insights API.
- Vercel Analytics ready (no cookie banner required).

### Forms

- Contact form built on `react-hook-form` + `zod` with character counter, response-time
  badge, and a three-step "what happens next" timeline.
- `POST /api/contact` validates the payload and dispatches via Resend; without
  `RESEND_API_KEY` it gracefully falls back to a logged response so previews never break.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

### Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev               # development server
pnpm build             # production build
pnpm start             # serve the production build
pnpm lint              # ESLint with the Next.js config
pnpm test:e2e:install  # install the Playwright browsers (one-off)
pnpm test:e2e          # run the Playwright smoke tests
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key. If unset, the form silently logs and returns `{ ok: true, delivered: false }`. |
| `CONTACT_INBOX` | Inbox that receives form submissions. Defaults to `hello@nova-agency.studio`. |
| `RESEND_FROM` | Verified Resend sender (e.g. `NOVA Studio <hello@your-domain.com>`). |

## Theming

Themes are driven by HSL CSS variables in `globals.css` and orchestrated by `next-themes`
with `attribute="class"`. The theme switch uses the View Transitions API with a radial
`clip-path` reveal and falls back to a CSS-only crossfade. Dark is the default.

## Contact API

`POST /api/contact` accepts a JSON body, validates it with Zod, and forwards it to Resend:

```ts
{
  name: string;        // 2..80 chars
  email: string;       // RFC 5322 valid
  company?: string;    // 0..100 chars
  budget?: string;     // one of the UI options
  message: string;     // 20..1000 chars
}
```

The endpoint always returns 200 with `{ ok, delivered }` so previews never error out, even
without a `RESEND_API_KEY`.

---

## Quality bar

- `pnpm lint` — clean, zero warnings.
- `pnpm build` — strict TypeScript, production build passes.
- `pnpm test:e2e` — Playwright smoke tests cover the home page, locale switch,
  the contact API, and the `/work` and `/journal` index pages.
- GitHub Actions runs lint, build, and the Playwright suite on every push and pull request.
- Lighthouse 95+ on the deployed build (live badge in the footer).
- All animations honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- WCAG AA contrast on dark and light themes.
- Keyboard-accessible: every interactive element is reachable, every focus state is visible.

## Continuous integration

The [`CI`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow runs on every push and pull request:

1. **Lint & build** — `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`.
2. **End-to-end** — installs the Chromium browser, builds the app, and runs the Playwright
   smoke suite against the production build. The HTML report is uploaded as an artifact.
